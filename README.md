  primary: |
    The primary colours are shades of sky-blue to create a welcoming aesthetic to the site. The blue could also be compared to baby-blue, a colour often associated with the welcoming of a new baby. In the case of Loyal Rescue it's the welcoming of a new member of the family.
  secondary: |
    The Secondary colour is a light magenta- to re-enforce the idea of adoption as a familiar and personal process (baby blue and pink).
  neutral: |
    The Neutral colours are shades of gray as not to distract form the harmony of the primary and secondary colours.
